## Background

### What:
The Boomerang is a journal application that supports the modern lifestyle and utilizes machine learning to provide users with actionable and informative feedback.
### Why:
By adapting journaling methods to the modern on-the-move lifestyle, more people will be able to reap the benefits of journaling.
### For whom:
The target group for the Boomerang application are people who would like to journal but are for some reason not doing so.
How we have adopted journaling to the modern lifestyle:
Talking to people, we understood that allocating time to journal, either in the morning or evening, was one of the main thresholds of starting of journaling. Research also suggests that, on the average, people pick up their mobile phones [around 60 times per day](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/21/cellphone-screen-time-average-habits) and about half of the time spent on their phone, [they spend on social media platforms](https://techjury.net/blog/time-spent-on-social-media/#gref). That indicates that people, on the average, have a lot of idle time throughout the day.
Thus, the Boomerang application is designed for people to journal during idle times throughout the day, instead of taking extended time off during the morning or evening to do so. Since people already spend a lot of that idle time using social media platforms, the Boomerang design takes inspiration from them. Meaning that how you write a journal entry in the Boomerang application is designed in a similar way of how messages are shared between people on social media platforms.  
We have also learned that for some people who have tried journaling, lack of engagement was the reason for why they had not continued with the activity. Thus, the Boomerang application utilizes machine learning to analyze diary inputs and provides users with useful insights about their input. Therefore, the Boomerang supports users in locating the stressors in their lives by connecting actions and emotions together. These findings are presented in the form of insights provided to users and are meant to increase engagement.
### The benefits of the Boomerang:
The average person spends between [3 to 4 hours watching the screen](https://elitecontentmarketer.com/screen-time-statistics/) on their phone each day, and in the United States that average time is increasing every year. In another survey from the United States, 46% of respondents stated they spend between 5-6 hours a day on their phone. [Research](https://www.gadget-cover.com/blog/what-are-the-most-popular-reasons-why-people-use-their-smartphones-every-day) also suggests that younger generations spend more time on their phones than older generations.
Mobile phones are powerful tools that provide a lot of value to their users. The problem is though that too much screen time can have negative consequences such as loss of cognitive ability in the form of [“poorer concentration, weaker memory, slower information processing and weaker impulse control”](https://www.activehealth.sg/read/screen-time/what-are-the-negative-side-effects-of-too-much-screen-time). A potential reason for why is because of [information overload and instant gratification](https://www.activehealth.sg/read/screen-time/what-are-the-negative-side-effects-of-too-much-screen-time) received from browsing social media, which is [a very common thing](https://elitecontentmarketer.com/screen-time-statistics/) to do on your phone.   
One way to increase one’s own cognitive abilities is to journal. It is an ancient activity where people reflect on their actions, feelings, and thoughts by writing them down. By doing so, people can better understand their feelings, thoughts and how they connect to their actions. 
So what Boomerang offers is a chance to utilize the time spent on the mobile in a better way, rather than decreasing the time spent on the phone. It is a way to reflect on yourself during idle moments rather then browsing social media and reflecint on others people’s life.

## Results

To evaluate the design, we conducted interviews with two potential users. Both users are 28 years of age, one female and one male, are currently not journaling but would like to. During both interviews the interviewer explained the app’s purpose, showed the current prototype, and asked about the main functions.

Through the interviews we learned that:

·   	To write a journal input in the Boomerang is simple and easy.

·   	Journaling throughout their day was something they could both see themselves doing. “A perfect moment to use an app like that is when you have 5 minutes while waiting for someone or while transporting.”

·   	They ad value to the user, with the fact that they receive insights. “Insights could be helpful to help me to understand how I feel, structure me and support me in my reflection. Sometimes you are unsure of how you feel when you write.”

·   	It is very important to be able to provide feedback on the insights but the current way of thumbs down or thumbs up are confusing. The most important thing is to be able to inform the application when an insight is not correct and one suggested that the insights should be editable.  

·   	For them the usefulness of journaling is to understand their current state of mind but also to revisit later. The current version of the app is thought to be good for the former but not the latter. To improve that the history section of the app could be structured better by also providing the option to filter by topics or emotions.

·   	Both wanted the option to upload photos in order to revisit old memories, which is currently not available in the application. “I want to go back to the difficult and good times, revisit them and see what I was thinking at that time. Pictures really add to ability to being able to revisit memories because sometimes words don’t make any justice.”
·   	Data protection is important for diaries and the fact that the Boomerang does not share diary inputs with any third parties was very important.
 
Based on those evaluations we seem to be on the right track towards creating an application that can support people journaling throughout the day in a simple and easy way. It is a journal application that supports people in the moment but might need more support and structure to offer more flexibility towards revisiting old memories. 

The reason for why the app currently does not allow photo input is because the text recognition technology would not be able to understand the input. Thus, the next step should be to explore further whether that matters or not for users and whether if photo input would be detrimental to the simplicity of the app.
