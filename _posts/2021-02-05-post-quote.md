## Background

### What:
The Boomerang is a journal application that supports the modern lifestyle and utilizes machine learning to provide users with actionable and informative feedback.
### Why:
By adapting journaling methods to the modern on-the-move lifestyle, more people will be able to reap the benefits of journaling.
### For whom:
The target group for the Boomerang application are people who would like to journal but are for some reason not doing so.
How we have adopted journaling to the modern lifestyle:
Talking to people, we understood that allocating time to journal, either in the morning or evening, was one of the main thresholds of starting of journaling. Research also suggests that, on the average, people pick up their mobile phones [around 60 times per day](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/21/cellphone-screen-time-average-habits) and about half of the time spent on their phone, [they spend on social media platforms](https://techjury.net/blog/time-spent-on-social-media/#gref). That indicates that people, on the average, have a lot of idle time throughout the day.
Thus, the Boomerang application is designed for people to journal during idle times throughout the day, instead of taking extended time off during the morning or evening to do so. Since people already spend a lot of that idle time using social media platforms, the Boomerang design takes inspiration from them. Meaning that how you write a journal entry in the Boomerang application is designed in a similar way of how messages are shared between people on social media platforms.  
We have also learned that for some people who have tried journaling, lack of engagement was the reason for why they had not continued with the activity. Thus, the Boomerang application utilizes machine learning to analyze diary inputs and provides users with useful insights about their input. Therefore, the Boomerang supports users in locating the stressors in their lives by connecting actions and emotions together. These findings are presented in the form of insights provided to users and are meant to increase engagement.
### The benefits of the Boomerang:
The average person spends between [3 to 4 hours watching the screen](https://elitecontentmarketer.com/screen-time-statistics/) on their phone each day, and in the United States that average time is increasing every year. In another survey from the United States, 46% of respondents stated they spend between 5-6 hours a day on their phone. [Research](https://www.gadget-cover.com/blog/what-are-the-most-popular-reasons-why-people-use-their-smartphones-every-day) also suggests that younger generations spend more time on their phones than older generations.
Mobile phones are powerful tools that provide a lot of value to their users. The problem is though that too much screen time can have negative consequences such as loss of cognitive ability in the form of [“poorer concentration, weaker memory, slower information processing and weaker impulse control”](https://www.activehealth.sg/read/screen-time/what-are-the-negative-side-effects-of-too-much-screen-time). A potential reason for why is because of [information overload and instant gratification](https://www.activehealth.sg/read/screen-time/what-are-the-negative-side-effects-of-too-much-screen-time) received from browsing social media, which is [a very common thing](https://elitecontentmarketer.com/screen-time-statistics/) to do on your phone.   
[One way to increase one’s own cognitive abilities is to journal](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentID=4552&ContentTypeID=1). It is an ancient activity where people reflect on their actions, feelings, and thoughts by writing them down. By doing so, people can better understand their feelings, thoughts and how they connect to their actions. 
So what Boomerang offers is a chance to utilize the time spent on the mobile in a better way, rather than decreasing the time spent on the phone. It is a way to reflect on yourself during idle moments rather then browsing social media and reflecint on others people’s life.
