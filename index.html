# About

I am a ~~programmer + engineer + economist + academic + musician + writer + strategist + photographer + YouTuber + philosopher + teacher~~ designer + computer scientist born in Turkey, currently based in ~~Istanbul~~ Gothenburg.

I'm currently teaching at the joint Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, and working on two strands of research:

- [Social Drones](https://www.baytas.net/research/socialdrones/) :: informing and creating designs for interactive autonomous drones, mainly for leisure and wellness applications.  
- [Digital Preciousness](https://www.baytas.net/research/digitalpreciousness/) :: experimenting with product and user interface designs that embody longevity and value.  

I also produce and host [Design Disciplin](https://www.designdisciplin.com/) -- a [video](https://www.youtube.com/designdisciplin) [podcast](https://podcast.designdisciplin.com/) and [website]((https://www.designdisciplin.com/)) that seeks to illuminate diverse patches on the vast landscape of "design".
